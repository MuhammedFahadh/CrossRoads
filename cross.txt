            <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://spsonline.in/"><span class="text-warning">School of Practical Studies (SPS)</span></a> helps the young Indian generation who had benefited nothing from our countryâ€™s poor education system by providing an intensive industry relevant training on the leading software technologies.

            The SPS program is completely FREE upfront and our students pay zero tuition fee until they land a job. We believe everyone should get the right opportunities to learn, hence we do not charge any fees upfront.
            
            SPS is not just another training institute where you go learn something and leave forever. SPS is a community of high performance people who support each other and to win together. Each SPS grad will always be in touch with our community and help the new buddies as a way of giving back.
